# Creating a playlist in spotify for particular date

### Given that you have installed all the required dependencies using `pipenv install`

### things you should do on your part:
1. [create a spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
2. take the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from there and create a .env file using the same name as `key=value`
3. now goto your spotify account : https://open.spotify.com/user/{X}]
4. also save `X` as `USER_ID` same way as in step 2
5. `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`, you really don't need to worry much about this, just give a localhost url like `http://localhost:8080`

#### that's all, enjoy!!
